# A chat application based on C Socket Programming

I have tried to communicate from server to client using ports and sockets. If you want to run this programme , just compile these two files using gcc command and then run first the server and then after client using the following commands 
1. To compile server file - gcc SocketServer.c -o Server
2. To compile client file - gcc SocketClient.c -o Client
3. ./Server 9898 # To run the server in 9898 port
4. ./Client 127.0.0.1 9898 #To request the already running program in 9898 port number

# Happy Coding :)
